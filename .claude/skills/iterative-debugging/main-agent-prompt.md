# Iterative Debugging — Coordinator Agent Guide

> **What:** Each task goes through two stages. Stage 1 (a subagent): explore the scene once,
> generate initial code without an external baseline, debug the assigned development seeds
> (LIBERO: 51–65), select one fix, and grade the skills it used. Stage 2 (a script you run):
> validate the selected fix on held-out seeds 1–$HELDOUT_COUNT. Alongside those, a **verifier**
> subagent tests any skills the task proposed, and **you** choose what runs next and curate the
> library.
> **Your second job:** you are the curriculum. Task order is your decision, made from what the
> library can currently teach — see [Curriculum](#curriculum-choosing-what-runs-next).
> **Campaign root:** every pipeline invocation gets one timestamped directory,
> `RUN_ROOT=outputs/runs/<stamp>/`, created once at kickoff with `scripts/init_run.py`
> (which also points `outputs/runs/LATEST` at it). All task artifacts live under
> `$RUN_ROOT/<benchmark>/<suite>/task_<id>/`.
> **Tasks:** `$RUN_ROOT/tasks.json` — the campaign task list, written once at kickoff from the
> user's request (any `(benchmark, suite, task_id)` cases) via `init_run.py --tasks`.
> **Progress:** `$RUN_ROOT/progress.md` — single source of truth for task status; always
> regenerate it with `scripts/gen_progress.py` before reading it.
> **Subagent template:** [subagent-prompt.md](subagent-prompt.md)

For a Robosuite task list, initialize with:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/iterative-debugging/scripts/init_run.py \
  --tasks <tasks.json> --dev-seeds $(seq 101 125) --unseen-seeds $(seq 126 130) \
  --heldout-count 100
```

LIBERO keeps the existing defaults: development 51–65, unseen-check 66–70, held-out 1–50.
Read `dev_seeds`, `unseen_seeds`, and `heldout_count` from `$RUN_ROOT/campaign.json` when
assigning or resuming work. Pass them as DEV_SEEDS, UNSEEN_SEEDS, and HELDOUT_COUNT. Keep
existing run settings.

---

## Task Lifecycle

Every task moves through exactly these states (as reported by `gen_progress.py`):

```
pending ──(dispatch Stage 1 subagent)──► stage1-done ──(run Stage 2 eval script)──► done
```

- **`pending`** → dispatch a subagent (Stage 1). Never run Stage 2 on a pending task.
- **`stage1-done`** → `fix_code.py` exists; verify the handoff gate below, then run the Stage 2
  validation **script** yourself in the background. **Never dispatch a subagent for a `stage1-done` task** — it would redo Stage 1
  from scratch and could overwrite a good `fix_code.py`.
- **`done`** → all $HELDOUT_COUNT held-out seeds on disk. **NEVER touch a `done` task.**
  Re-dispatching or re-evaluating creates duplicate run dirs and corrupts benchmark results. (The
  one exception is the end-of-campaign rerun sweep, which writes to a fresh directory and never
  overwrites — see [Rerun sweep](#phase-3-the-rerun-sweep).)

## Skill Lifecycle

Skills move on their own track, reported in the `Skills` column:

```
none ──(subagent proposes)──► proposed ──(dispatch verifier)──► verified ──(you promote)──► in library
                                                            └─► refuted ──► not promoted
```

**Skill verification gates promotion into the library, not the task's own Stage 2.** The two are
independent: start a task's eval as soon as its subagent returns, whether or not its skills have
been verified. Coupling them would stall benchmark results behind library bookkeeping for no gain.

---

## GPU Ownership Ledger

The user assigns the simulation GPU set at kickoff. Follow the configured provider placement
when identifying available simulation GPUs. You are the only allocator of the assigned
simulation GPUs. Keep an explicit ledger in your working notes, e.g.:

```
GPU <assigned id>: SUBAGENT  libero-pro/libero_goal_swap/task_02   (dispatched)
GPU <assigned id>: EVAL      libero-pro/libero_object_task/task_05 (background, started)
GPU <assigned id>: FREE
...
```

Rules:

1. **One job per GPU, ever.** A job is either a Stage 1 subagent or a Stage 2 eval.
2. **A GPU stays owned by its task from subagent dispatch until that task's Stage 2 eval
   finishes.** When a subagent returns, immediately start Stage 2 for that task on the **same
   GPU** — do not give that GPU to a new subagent until the eval completes.
3. **Never trust `nvidia-smi` to decide a GPU is free.** Subagents idle between runs and the eval
   script spawns a fresh process per seed, so an owned GPU often shows 0 processes. `nvidia-smi`
   is a sanity check only:

   ```bash
   nvidia-smi -i "$GPU" --query-compute-apps=pid --format=csv,noheader,nounits
   ```

   Check each assigned GPU (a) at session start, before claiming it, and (b) when a subagent's
   result is missing its `GPU:` line. Cross-check against your ledger.
4. If you are resuming a session and have no ledger, rebuild it: regenerate progress, check
   `nvidia-smi`, and check for running background tasks before dispatching anything.

---

## Initialization: Verify Perception Services

Before dispatching any subagents, confirm the services this campaign's benchmark needs are up
(200 = UP, 000 = DOWN):

```bash
for p in $SERVICE_PORTS; do
  echo "port $p: $(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' --max-time 3 http://127.0.0.1:$p/openapi.json)"
done
```

| Port | Service | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| 8114 | SAM3 | every benchmark |
| 8115 | Contact-GraspNet | libero-pro, robosuite |
| 8116 | PyRoki | libero-pro, robosuite |
| 8118 | cuRobo | programs that select a cuRobo strategy; the robosuite bimanual gate |

BEHAVIOR-1K campaigns use only 8114 and 8115 and their own guide,
[behavior/main-agent-prompt.md](behavior/main-agent-prompt.md).

The per-benchmark values of `$SERVICE_PORTS`, `$CAP_HARNESS`, `$INIT_MODE`, `$RUN_ENV` and
`$RUN_FLAGS` are in the Benchmark Profiles table of `subagent-prompt.md`; brief every subagent
with the row for this campaign's benchmark.

If any service is down, start them with `scripts/supervise_services.sh` (in a persistent
terminal such as tmux) before proceeding — subagents will fail silently without them.

**cuRobo answers its first request slowly.** The port serves 200 as soon as the process is up,
but the first plan for a given robot model builds a planner and warms CUDA graphs, which takes
around 50 s; later plans are tens of milliseconds. Send one throwaway plan after starting the
supervisor rather than letting a subagent's first real call absorb that cost and read as a hang.
If you wrap the supervisor in your own health-checking loop, give it a tolerance longer than that
build: a wrapper that restarts cuRobo mid-build presents to subagents as `provider_unavailable`,
which reads like a program bug and costs a debugging round to diagnose.

`scripts/supervise_services.sh` starts `sam3,pyroki,curobo` by default, so cuRobo is available to
every subagent without a flag.

## The Loop

```
pick next tasks (curriculum) → regenerate+read progress → fill assigned GPUs → GO IDLE
        ↑                        (pending→subagent, stage1-done→eval, proposed→verifier)   │
        │                                                                                  │
        │   on SUBAGENT completion:  act on skill grades, start Stage 2 eval on that same  │
        │                            GPU, dispatch a verifier if skills were proposed      │
        │   on VERIFIER completion:  verified → promote; refuted → do not promote          │
        │   on EVAL completion:      GPU is now free → assign it the next task             │
        └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Repeat until every task is `done`, then run the rerun sweep once (phase 3).

---

## Coordinator Rules

1. **Dispatch subagents — never debug yourself.** Your only jobs: choose what runs next, dispatch
   subagents and verifiers, run Stage 2 evals, curate the skill library, keep the ledger.
2. **Go idle after dispatching.** You are notified automatically when a subagent, verifier, or
   background eval finishes. Do not poll, monitor processes, or watch GPUs while jobs are running.
3. **Keep every assigned GPU occupied** — with subagents, verifiers, *or* evals, one job per GPU
   (see ledger rules).
4. **Never read task-specific debug files.** Do not open `trace/events.jsonl`,
   `source/program.py`, `outcome.json`, or keyframe images of individual runs — that's subagent
   work. You may read `findings.md`, `skill_report.json`, `verification_report.json`, and
   `fix_code.py` — these are the curation record, and reading `fix_code.py` is expected: it is
   where you extract the code snippet being promoted.
5. **Route by state:** `pending` → subagent; `stage1-done` → Stage 2 eval script; `proposed` →
   verifier; `done` → never touch. Before starting a Stage 2 eval for a `stage1-done` task, check
   your ledger — if an eval for that task is already running, do not start a second one (the
   progress file cannot see in-flight evals).
7. **Only verified skills enter the library.** Never promote a proposal a verifier has not
   returned `verified` on, and never promote on a `void`. An unverified proposal that reads well
   is exactly the failure this pipeline exists to prevent.
6. **Enforce the non-privileged provenance gate.** Dispatch the complete subagent template,
   including its forbidden-API and provenance rules. A returned task must explicitly report
   `Non-privileged API audit: PASS` before Stage 2 or skill promotion. If the audit is missing or
   quarantined, do not evaluate, promote, or redispatch that task; preserve its artifacts and
   report it as invalid.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Regenerate and read progress

Always regenerate before reading — the file on disk is stale otherwise:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/iterative-debugging/scripts/gen_progress.py
cat "$RUN_ROOT/progress.md"
```

(`gen_progress.py` targets `outputs/runs/LATEST` by default; pass `--run-root "$RUN_ROOT"` when
working with an older campaign.)

**Start the watchdog once, at kickoff, and re-arm it whenever it fires.** An agent blocked on an
approval prompt does not fail, it waits, and it looks exactly like one that is thinking — this
cost one campaign **29.5 hours**, including a single 14 h 18 m block. Keep `live_agents.txt`
current: rewrite it on every dispatch and every completion, because a watchdog that alarms on
agents which merely *finished* is one you will start ignoring.

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/iterative-debugging/scripts/watchdog.py \
    --live-file "$RUN_ROOT/live_agents.txt" &
```

It exits when something has been quiet past `--idle-limit`, printing the agent's last shell
command — which is almost always the thing awaiting approval.

### The other scripts, and when you want them

| Script | Use it when |
|---|---|
| `dispatch.py` | Staging any worker or verifier package (step 3 and step 7). |
| `lint_skills.py` | **After every skill promotion.** Fails on a fence the sandbox rejects, a helper defined nowhere, or a search with no empty case; warns on a loop with no tick cost. |
| `watchdog.py` | Continuously, from kickoff. |
| `trace_stats.py` | Reporting a campaign's cost. Run `--histogram` first and set `--stall-gap` from your own gap distribution, not from the default. |
| `audit_seeding.py` | Before trusting any headline number, and after any change to the adapter's reset path. Four checks; a campaign has already lost every pre-fix sweep to a seeding bug none of them was running. |

### 2. Fill every free GPU

For each GPU your ledger shows FREE, assign one job, choosing tasks in the order your curriculum
decision set ([Curriculum](#curriculum-choosing-what-runs-next)):

- Next `pending` task → dispatch a Stage 1 subagent (step 3).
- Next `stage1-done` task with no eval in flight → start a Stage 2 eval in the background (see
  Stage 2 section).
- Task with `proposed` skills and no verifier in flight → dispatch a verifier (step 7).

Update the ledger, send all dispatches in one message, then **stop and go idle**.

### 3. Dispatching a Stage 1 subagent

Assign MAX_STEPS once (default 1000 unless configured otherwise) and use it for
both development and evaluation, with the benchmark's INIT_MODE. Keep camera settings consistent
between stages; the existing defaults are 800×512.
Use the configured benchmark runtime/container.

Keep the worker on the first seed in DEV_SEEDS until actual success, then test and adapt on the rest.
Do not cap attempts while diagnostics make progress. On a plateau, review its
findings and suggest a new diagnostic or resolve the resource limit. Keep the task
pending before first-development-seed success. After generalization work, accept complete tested
coverage with honest remaining failures; 100% success is not required. Respect
user budgets.

Copy the template from [subagent-prompt.md](subagent-prompt.md), fill in BENCHMARK, SUITE,
TASK_ID, GPU, RUN_ROOT, MAX_STEPS, DEV_SEEDS, UNSEEN_SEEDS, and HELDOUT_COUNT:

```python
Agent(
    description="Fix loop: <suite>/task_<id>",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt=<filled-in template from subagent-prompt.md>,
    run_in_background=True
)
```

Always pass the **full suite name** (see collision warning below).

### 4. On SUBAGENT completion

The result includes `GPU: <N>` (if missing, use your ledger + the nvidia-smi fallback). Then, in
order:

1. Confirm the returned summary says `Non-privileged API audit: PASS`. If it is missing or says
   `QUARANTINED`, preserve the artifacts, report the task as invalid, and do not run Stage 2,
   promote findings, or redispatch it; stop handling that task.
2. Check the worker's selected artifacts before evaluation: all seeds in $DEV_SEEDS have
   finalized, matching-source runs at the assigned settings with all published camera videos;
   reported flags match outcomes and the first development seed succeeded without a program
   error. The audit, numbered source and `fix_code.py` hashes must agree. Confirm
   findings, the absolute video index, and that all simulator children have exited.
   Return missing coverage/artifacts to the same worker. File existence alone is
   not readiness; regenerate progress and confirm `stage1-done` after these checks.
3. Compare the two rates in the summary: a program strong on development seeds but weak on the
   unseen-check seeds (LIBERO: 66–70; Robosuite: 126–130) is overfitted, and its held-out result
   will be poor. Still run Stage 2 -- that is the measurement -- but treat any skill it proposes
   with the same suspicion, since a pattern extracted from an overfitted program is a pattern
   that did not generalize to seeds it had never touched.
4. **Start the Stage 2 eval for this task, on this same GPU, in the background** (see Stage 2
   section). The GPU remains owned by this task — do NOT dispatch a new subagent on it.
5. Act on the skill grades in `skill_report.json` (step 6a). Repair anything graded `wrong`
   **before** dispatching another subagent — every task dispatched against a known-broken skill
   pays for it again.
6. If the task proposed skills, write `verification/proposed_skills.md` and dispatch a verifier
   (step 7).
7. Update the ledger (`SUBAGENT` → `EVAL`) and go idle.

### 4b. On VERIFIER completion

1. Read `verification_report.json`. On `verified`, promote the proposals (step 6c). On `refuted`,
   do not promote — record the `gaps` text against the proposal so a later task can rewrite it
   rather than rediscover the same dead end. On `void`, discard the result entirely and, if the
   cause was a breach of the reading rules, dispatch a fresh verifier.
2. If you promoted anything, the library hash has changed. Every task dispatched from now on sees
   the new library; tasks already done under the old one become rerun candidates for phase 3.
3. Update the ledger and go idle.

### 5. On EVAL completion

1. Regenerate progress and confirm the task shows `done` ($HELDOUT_COUNT/$HELDOUT_COUNT results). If seeds are missing,
   re-run the same eval command with `--resume` on the same GPU.
2. The GPU is now genuinely free — mark it FREE in the ledger and assign it the next job
   (step 2).
3. Go idle.

### 6. Update skills

After each subagent completion, read the task's `findings.md` and `skill_report.json` (the
subagent is required to write both) and act on them in this order. Subagents and verifiers never
write to `skills/` — only you do. If `findings.md` is missing, note it and use the subagent's
returned summary instead.

**6a. Act on the grades first.** `skill_report.json` says how the library performed. A bad entry
costs every future task the same detour, so repairs outrank additions:

| Verdict | What you do |
|---|---|
| `wrong` | Fix or delete it **now**, before dispatching anything else. It is actively breaking tasks. |
| `misleading` | Narrow the trigger, or add the counter-case the subagent hit. Do not just append a warning below it — a reader who follows the section top-down never reaches the caveat. |
| `useful` | Add the new evidence (task, seeds) to the existing entry. Repeated independent confirmation is what turns a pattern into a rule. |
| `not-applicable` | No action. It maps where the library's edges are. |

When two tasks disagree about the same section — one `useful`, one `misleading` — that is not a
tie to break. **Ask whether the misfit is loud or silent**; the repair differs, and only one of
them is a trigger change.

| Misfit | Repair |
|---|---|
| **Loud** — the arm stalls, IK refuses, the jaw closes on air | Keep the trigger **broad** and add a **precondition**: a runnable check the reader executes first. `solve_ik` costs zero simulator ticks. |
| **Silent** — the recipe "succeeds" on the wrong object | **Narrow the trigger**, hard, and say what it was validated on. |

Default to the precondition. Narrowing costs a prose renegotiation every time a new scene
disagrees — one entry had three of its four `misleading` grades keep *every line* of the recipe and
object only to scope — while a broad trigger is nearly free: `not-applicable` was 394 of 1,372
consultations and costs a read. The silent case is the one that earns a hard scope line: a
horizontal-wrist approach outside its validated range gripped the drawer one shelf up and reported
`jaw_after_close` 0.0188 m, a real bar diameter, so every sanity check passed and the task scored
**0/50**.

**A precondition is code or it is nothing.** A scope claim you cannot write as a runnable check is
a note; put it in the body where no one has to adjudicate it.

**6b. Send proposals to a verifier, do not promote them directly.** `proposed_new` and
`proposed_edits` are claims, not findings. Promote a proposal only after a verifier returns
`verified` (step 7). This is the difference between a library of what worked and a library of
what someone believed.

**6c. Promote verified proposals.** Route by topic: SAM3 prompts and disambiguation →
[skills/localize.md](skills/localize.md); grasp selection, offsets, verification →
[skills/grasp.md](skills/grasp.md); waypoints, transit, placement →
[skills/transport.md](skills/transport.md); drawer/knob/push techniques →
[skills/manipulation.md](skills/manipulation.md).

**Write each pattern in the richest form that fits — do not default to a table row.**

- **Default format: a freeform subsection**, modeled on the existing ones ("Pre-Probe IK
  Conditioning" in transport.md, "Disambiguation" in localize.md):
  - **Trigger** — the symptom or scene condition that calls for the pattern.
  - **Code** — the working snippet (5–20 lines). Open the task's `fix_code.py` (and the snippet
    in `findings.md`) and extract the real code, generalizing task-specific prompts and
    constants into placeholders. Do not paraphrase code into prose.
  - **Why it works + evidence** — one or two sentences, plus which task/seeds it fixed.
- **Table rows are only for one-line lookups** — a prompt string, a Z formula, a numeric
  threshold. If the Notes cell needs a sentence of procedure, it is not a table row: write a
  subsection (optionally with a table row pointing to it).
- **Merge, don't append.** If an existing section already covers the pattern, extend it — add
  the new evidence, widen the trigger, note the variant. Never add a table row that paraphrases
  an existing section.

**6d. An entry states what is TRUE NOW. Its history goes in the changelog.**

This rule exists because the previous campaign ignored it and `transport.md` reached 28,000 words
— 60% commentary, 31 headings against 191 correction blocks — before anyone noticed. Cost: one
task scored **0/5** by shipping the pre-correction form of a snippet whose correction sat one
section below it. "Merge, don't append" was already written above and was not enough, because
adding a blockquote *inside* a section technically merges. So, concretely:

| When a verifier or subagent corrects an entry | Do this |
|---|---|
| A claim is refuted | **Replace the claim.** The old wording goes to `<file>-changelog.md`, not into the entry under a strikethrough. |
| A number is re-measured | **Overwrite it.** One current band, not a lineage of three. |
| A correction belongs to a snippet | **Put it in the snippet as a comment.** Prose beside code does not protect the code — that is the 0/5 above. |
| Tasks genuinely disagree | Keep the disagreement, in one sentence, in a `**Limits.**` line. Unresolved is a legitimate state; four paragraphs arguing about it is not. |

An entry over ~400 words is a signal you are narrating rather than instructing. Run
`lint_skills.py` after every promotion; it fails the build on a search with no empty case and
flags entries that prescribe a loop with no tick cost or a reach figure with no gripper state.

**6f. An ablation the proposer ran on its OWN program is provenance, not evidence.** Record it
under `**Limits.**` with who measured it; never make it the `**Evidence.**` line, and never let it
turn a cost into a correctness claim. A one-line change to your own passing program varies *that
program's* tolerance for the line, not the line. Measured: a proposer ablated its drawer pull axis
to "toward the robot base" and reported **0/15**; a verifier re-ran the identical one-line change
on its own program and got **5/5**, at 882–916 ticks against 299–603. The axis was never a
correctness claim — it is a ~600-tick budget claim, free on a single-subgoal task and fatal on a
two-subgoal one. Both numbers were real; the proposer's was confounded, because on *its* program the
wrong axis also broke the standoff. Promote such a row to Evidence only if a verifier reproduced it
independently.

**6e. Do not promote a correction that has only agreeing evidence.** Four tasks agreeing is not
the same as one task disagreeing and losing. This campaign retired a descent test on three
contradicting measurements, replaced it with two rules, and had to retract one of them a day
later — the half that survived had faced disagreement, the half that failed had only ever been
confirmed. Before you write a new rule, ask which measurement would have refuted it, and whether
any task ran that measurement.

### 7. Dispatch a verifier for proposed skills

When a task's `skill_report.json` contains any `proposed_new` or `proposed_edits`,
`gen_progress.py` lists it under **Skill verification needed**. Dispatch one verifier per such
task **on a free GPU** — not on the one running that task's Stage 2 eval. A verifier is a full
job, and putting it beside an eval breaks the one-job-per-GPU rule and slows both. If no GPU is
free the verifier waits: it gates skill promotion, not the task's own result, so it is the thing
that can queue.

`scripts/dispatch.py` stages the package — the proposals, outside the task directory, plus the
verifier prompt with the standing addenda and disputes already filled in:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/iterative-debugging/scripts/dispatch.py verify \
    --suite "$SUITE" --task-id "$TASK_ID" --gpu "$GPU"
```

It prints the prompt path. **Dispatch the agent with "read this file and follow it exactly" —
never paste the contents inline**, or the record of what an agent was told dies with the context.
The same script stages workers (`dispatch.py worker ...`).

It refuses politely when a task proposed nothing, which is a real state and not an error: one task
this campaign finished with no `skill_report.json` at all and there was nothing to verify.

**Then read what it staged, and edit it.** Two things the script cannot judge:

- **Keep the pass counts, drop the seed identities.** "11/15 → 14/15 on development seeds" is what
  makes a claim worth testing; "seeds 53, 55, 60 flipped" tells the verifier which scenes to target
  and turns the check into a lookup. Rewrite those lines by hand. A find-and-replace over the
  numbers has already produced evidence reading "from a majority to a majority (some development
  seeds flipped)" — which a verifier correctly reported as unpromotable, because the provenance the
  library requires had been erased along with the seed numbers.
- **Strip any cross-reference into the proposer's own directory.** One proposal pointed at "the
  snippet in findings.md" — a file the verifier may not open. If a proposal needs code to be
  usable, the code has to be *in* it.

**Do not put `TASK_DIR` in the verifier's prompt.** It works only in `$VERIFY_DIR` and is never
told where the proposer's artifacts live — an isolation that is a stated rule *and* a path it
does not have. Naming the task directory to explain what to avoid hands over the index instead.

For a phase-3 rerun, append the attempt to the workspace name
(`..._task_${TASK_ID}__rerun_02`) so a rerun's verification does not overwrite the original's.

```python
Agent(
    description="Verify skills: <suite>/task_<id>",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt=<filled-in template from verifier-prompt.md>,
    run_in_background=True,
)
```

**On verifier completion:**

1. `verified` → promote the proposals into the library (step 6c). The verifier reproduced the fix
   from the skill text alone, so the text carries what it claims.
2. `refuted` → **do not promote.** Read `gaps` in `verification_report.json`: it names what the
   skill failed to convey. Either rewrite the proposal to close that gap and re-verify, or drop
   it. A refuted proposal is a good outcome — it is a bad skill caught before it misled anyone.
3. `void` → the run was broken or the reading rules were breached. The result says nothing about
   the skill. Fix the cause and dispatch a fresh verifier; never promote on a `void`.

A verifier passing on the task its skill came from means the skill **transmits** — a fresh agent
can follow it to the fix. It does **not** mean the skill generalizes; that evidence only arrives
when a later, different task reports the skill `useful` in its own `skill_report.json`. Do not
describe a verified skill as proven general in the library text.

---

## Curriculum: choosing what runs next

Task order is yours to choose, and it matters: skills compound, so a task run early pays into
every task after it, while a task run before the library can help it wastes that opportunity.
There is no fixed policy — you decide each round from what the library can currently teach.

**Every round, before dispatching, append your decision to `$RUN_ROOT/curriculum.md`:**

```markdown
## Round <n> — <UTC timestamp>

Library now covers: <the capabilities with verified entries, and how strong each is>
Thin or missing: <capabilities with no verified entry>
Remaining tasks: <count>

Picked: <task refs>
Why: <the reasoning — which library sections you expect these tasks to draw on, and what you
      expect them to teach back>
Deferred: <task refs> until <what has to exist first>
```

Write this even when the choice is obvious. It is the only record of *why* the campaign ran in
the order it did, and at the end it is what tells you whether ordering helped.

**What to weigh:**

- **Feed the library where it is thin.** A capability with no verified entry (check the `Skills`
  column and the library itself) is where the next task teaches the most.
- **Spend the library where it is strong.** A task whose failure modes match a verified section
  is likelier to succeed *and* to confirm that section independently — which is what turns a
  one-task pattern into a rule.
- **Prefer transfer within a family.** Skills move most reliably between tasks in the same LIBERO
  family; a `libero_goal_swap` finding helps another goal task before it helps a spatial one.
- **Defer, explicitly.** If a task needs a capability the library cannot yet teach, say so and
  name what has to exist first. A deferred task with a stated precondition is a plan; a skipped
  task is an accident.
- **Do not starve a family.** Deferring everything hard produces a library that only knows easy
  scenes. If a capability stays thin for two rounds, run a task that needs it anyway and let the
  failure teach you.

You are not required to fill every GPU from a single family or round. Keeping GPUs busy
([The Loop](#the-loop)) outranks curriculum tidiness — if your preferred next task is blocked,
dispatch the best available one and record why.

## Phase 3: the rerun sweep

The campaign runs in three phases. Phases 1 and 2 are the loop above; phase 3 happens once.

1. **Run every task**, growing the library as you go.
2. **Rank** — once nothing is `pending` or `stage1-done`, `gen_progress.py` lists a **Rerun
   sweep** section: tasks that scored below the threshold *and* ran under a library that has
   since changed. A task already at the current library hash is not a candidate; rerunning it
   would only reproduce its own result.
3. **Rerun** those tasks against the final library.

**Do not rerun before every task is done.** The whole value of a single sweep is that each rerun
sees the richest library the campaign produced; rerunning mid-campaign spends GPU time on a
library that is still moving.

A rerun **never overwrites the first attempt.** Dispatch the normal Stage 1 subagent template
with `TASK_DIR` pointed at `$RUN_ROOT/<benchmark>/<suite>/task_<id>/rerun_02`, then run Stage 2
against `rerun_02/fix_code.py` with `--output-root` inside that directory. The original evidence
stays exactly as it was, and the two results are directly comparable — same task, same seeds,
different library. Record both in your summary; a rerun that scores *worse* is a real signal that
something promoted into the library is harmful.

## Stage 2: Held-Out Evaluation (seeds 1–$HELDOUT_COUNT) — run by the coordinator

Set `VALIDATION_WORKERS=4` for LIBERO-Pro or Robosuite. BEHAVIOR must use
`VALIDATION_WORKERS=1` and its own benchmark guide: Isaac shutdown requires a fresh process
for every episode, not a reusable batch worker.

Run this yourself, in the background, on the GPU the task already owns (`$GPU` below = that GPU).
Subagents never run Stage 2.

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/iterative-debugging/scripts/run_validation.py \
  --benchmark "$BENCHMARK" --suite "$SUITE" --task-id "$TASK_ID" --gpu "$GPU" \
  --run-root "$RUN_ROOT" \
  --program "$RUN_ROOT/$BENCHMARK/$SUITE/task_$TASK_ID/fix_code.py" \
  --cap-harness "$CAP_HARNESS" --init-mode "$INIT_MODE" \
  --max-steps "$MAX_STEPS" \
  --seeds $(seq 1 $HELDOUT_COUNT) --resume --workers "$VALIDATION_WORKERS"
```

`--workers 4` runs the sweep through `cap-harness run-batch`: seeds share worker processes, but
each still builds and closes its own environment, and each is still scored from its own
`outcome.json`. Measured on one L40, fifty seeds cost ~37 min one-process-per-seed, ~18 min at
`--workers 1`, and ~7 min at `--workers 4`; past four the curve flattens (six workers bought 12%,
eight bought 19%, at half the efficiency). Lower it if the GPU is shared with a subagent.
`--workers 1` is the original one-process-per-seed path, unchanged.

Always pass `--run-root "$RUN_ROOT"` (as above) so the eval and its progress regeneration bind to
this campaign — otherwise the script defaults to `outputs/runs/LATEST`, which another concurrent
`init_run.py` could have repointed. `$HELDOUT_COUNT` is the campaign's held-out partition, written to `<run-root>/campaign.json` by
`init_run.py --heldout-count` (50 by default; Robosuite uses 100 with development seeds 101–125,
and an explicit reduced count remains supported). The script runs each seed with the benchmark's own init mode by default
and records an immutable manifest under
`$RUN_ROOT/$BENCHMARK/$SUITE/task_$TASK_ID/validation/runs/<run_id>/` (videos, rollout results,
and per-seed logs included). Freeze the selected policy throughout evaluation.
Never send evaluation failures back for development tuning. Disclose any reuse of
a previously exercised evaluation partition. Regenerate progress after it finishes.
A task is `done` only with all `$HELDOUT_COUNT` held-out results on disk.

## Single-GPU Operating Mode

When the campaign has one GPU (`GPUS=1`), this section overrides coordinator rules 1 and 4 —
those assume one subagent per free GPU:

- The ledger has exactly one row, and work is strictly serial: Stage 0 + Stage 1 for a task, then
  its Stage 2, then the next task. Never start a second task's episodes while one is running.
- **You run every `cap-harness run` yourself.** Subagents do read-only analysis of finished run
  directories: they read `outcome.json`, `trace/events.jsonl`, `source/program-result.json`,
  `logs/program.stdout` and the videos, and they write only inside `$TASK_DIR`. A subagent that
  needs an episode asks you for it and you run it.
- Budget by measured episode cost. A full development partition of a slow simulator can take over an hour
  of wall clock; plan the day around that.

## LIBERO Suite Name Collision Warning

All six LIBERO-Pro swap/task suite pairs share identical task ids:
- `libero_goal_swap` ↔ `libero_goal_task`
- `libero_object_swap` ↔ `libero_object_task`
- `libero_spatial_swap` ↔ `libero_spatial_task`

Always include the full SUITE name when briefing a subagent.
- **`_swap` suites:** object positions randomized per seed — SAM3 handles naturally
- **`_task` suites:** language goal remapped — the BDDL-derived task name is misleading, always
  use `get_task_context().language`
