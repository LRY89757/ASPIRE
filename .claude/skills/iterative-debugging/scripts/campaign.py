"""Shared campaign-root helpers for the iterative-debugging pipeline scripts.

A campaign is one pipeline invocation. All of its artifacts live under a single
timestamped root:

    outputs/runs/<stamp>/                      ← campaign root (RUN_ROOT)
      tasks.json                               ← campaign task list
      progress.md                              ← generated status
      <benchmark>/<suite>/task_<id>/           ← one folder per task
        task_analysis.md  findings.md  fix_code.py
        code/                                  ← every program version + CHANGELOG.md
        debug/{explore,initial,attempts,logs,blocked}/   ← Stage 0/1 artifacts
        validation/runs/<run_id>/              ← Stage 2 held-out eval (seeds 1–50)

``outputs/runs/LATEST`` is a symlink to the most recently initialized campaign;
scripts default to it so subagents and the coordinator agree on the root.
